Wine
====

A simple crawler to the [www.wine.com.br](www.wine.com.br) website it is a Brazilian online wine store and also a wine club.

I write this crawler to learn how to write a simple crawler and also to have a way to follow the price changes.

It still a working in progress, the code/architecture can be a lot improved and many other cool thins can be implemented.


Next steps
----------

- Improve the parser
- Improve the crawler
- Improve the database/storage (maybe use Postgers + Docker + Docker-compose)
- Write a simple searching page
- Write a CRUD
- Write a REST API
